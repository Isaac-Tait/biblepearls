            <h3>The Birth of Jesus</h3>
            <p>
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>18</span>
              &nbsp;Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his
              mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together,
              she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>19</span>
              &nbsp;Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing
              to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>20</span>
              &nbsp;But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of
              the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, &quot;Joseph, son of
              David, don&#39;t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife,
              for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>21</span>
              &nbsp;She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name Jesus,
              for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.&quot;
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>22</span>
              &nbsp;Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which
              was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>23</span>
              &nbsp;&quot;Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall
              bring forth a son. They shall call his name Immanuel;&quot; which
              is, being interpreted, &quot;God with us.&quot;
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>24</span>
              &nbsp;Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the
              Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;
              <span className='pl-1 align-top text-xs text-red-500'>25</span>
              &nbsp;and didn&#39;t know her sexually until she had brought forth
              her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.
